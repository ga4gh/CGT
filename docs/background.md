The Cancer Gene Trust (CGT) is a decentralized, distributed content addressable real-time
database. Stewards working directly with patient-participants publish de-identified genomic and
basic clinical data. Researchers who find rare variants or combinations of variants in this global
resource that are associated with specific clinical features of interest may then contact the data
stewards for those participants. A submission consists of a manifest containing fields and
references to files by multihash. Initial submissions will likely include de-identified clinical
data, a list of somatic mutations, and gene expression data although any type of data can be
submitted and shared.
