# Cancer Gene Trust

The [GA4GH](http://ga4gh.org/#/cancergenetrust) Cancer Gene Trust (CGT) is a decentralized, 
distributed content addressable real-time database. Stewards working directly with 
patient-participants publish de-identified genomic and basic clinical data. Researchers 
who find rare variants or combinations of variants in this global resource that are 
associated with specific clinical features of interest may then contact the data stewards 
for those participants.

A submission consists of a JSON manifest containing fields and references to 
files by [mutlihash](https://github.com/multiformats/multihash). Initial submissions
will likely include de-identified clinical data, a list of somatic mutations, and
gene expression data although any type of data can be sumbitted and shared.
