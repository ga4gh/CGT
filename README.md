# Cancer Gene Trust

The [GA4GH](http://ga4gh.org/#/cancergenetrust) [Cancer Gene Trust (CGT)](https://github.com/ga4gh/CGT/blob/master/docs/background.md) is a decentralized 
distributed database of cancer variants and clinical data.

Stewards working directly with patient-participants publish de-identified somatic 
cancer variants and basic clinical data. Researchers who find rare variants 
or combinations of variants in this global resource that are associated with 
specific clinical features of interest may then contact the data stewards 
for those participants.

A submission consists of a JSON manifest file containing basic de-identified 
clinical data and references to one or more [VCF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variant_Call_Format) 
files. 

To get involved join the discussion at the [CGT mailing list](https://groups.google.com/a/genomicsandhealth.org/forum/#!forum/ga4gh-cgt)
